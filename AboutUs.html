    <h2>About us</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Oreen and this website is for my design project. This website was based off amazon and other shopping platforms. The idea of selling animals came from the fact that i originally wanted to create a website entirely dedicated to cats but i worried it would be too simple so i made a shopping website for selling animals. We tried our best to design our wesite to be suited for customer satisfaction, if you have any more questions or problems please head to the "contact us" page.</p>
    
    <h2>How can you trust us with selling animals?</h2>
    
    <p>This website was created for my design project, currently animals are out of stock but we can assure you we intend no harm to animals and other living beings. Though we can't be sure when our animals will be stocked, we can assure you that we do not handle animals as objects.</p>
    
    <h2>Is selling animals illegal?</h2>
    
    <p>Pet shops do it all the time. Imagine the website like a pet store but digital. Don't worry we do not sell endagerred or illegal animals nor do we sell humans or other humanoid species.</p>
